# Java Modernization Example

This project demonstrates the modernization of a legacy Java service into a modern, cloud-ready approach.

## Overview
The repository compares two implementations of the same business logic:
- Legacy imperative Java service
- Modern stateless service using Java Streams

## Structure
- User: domain entity
- UserServiceLegacy: traditional server-based approach (EC2-oriented)
- UserServiceModern: stateless and functional approach (AWS Lambda-ready)

## Key Topics
- Java Streams
- Stateless services
- Cloud modernization (EC2 vs Lambda)
- Cost and scalability considerations
